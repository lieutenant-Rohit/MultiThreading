1. What is a process ?
Ans ----> A process is an independent program that is being executed by the operating system.
Each process:
	•	Has its own memory space (RAM allocation).
	•	Has its own data, variables, stack, and system resources (like file handles, network connections).
	•	Is isolated — one process cannot directly access another process’s memory.

2. What is a thread?
Ans -----> A thread is a smaller unit of execution inside a process. It’s often called a lightweight process.
Each thread has:
	•	Its own stack memory (for method calls, local variables).
	•	Its own program counter (keeps track of which line of code is being executed).
	•	Its own registers.

But all threads share:
	•	The heap memory (objects, static variables, etc.)
	•	The code section of the program.

That’s why threads can communicate easily (shared data) — but that’s also why race conditions can occur if you’re not careful!

EXAMPLE ---->
Imagine your computer is a restaurant (the process).
	•	The restaurant (process) has shared resources like kitchen, tables, and menu (shared memory).
	•	Each waiter (thread) serves different customers simultaneously.
	•	All waiters (threads) share the same space and resources, but each handles their own task independently.

So, multiple waiters can serve multiple tables at once — that’s multithreading.

3. Creating a Process in Java.
Ans ----> To create a process we use ProcessBuilder Class .
Syntax - ProcessBuilder pb = new ProcessBuilder("java", "ChildProgram");
Explanation - The argument tell -> Run the java command and execute the child program.
This line is basically typing " java ChildProgram " in terminal.

Process process = pb.start();  ----> It tells the operating system to actually start the new process you described in ProcessBuilder.

4. Creating a Thread.
Ans ---->
Java gives you two main ways to create threads:
           	1.	Extend the Thread class
           	2.	Implement the Runnable interface

Case 1 -> Extend the Thread Class -> Refer to the Program in the Thread Package.
Case 2 -> Implement the Runnable interface -> Refer to the Program in the Thread Package.
